# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge required quering a weather database using python in a jupyter notebook and then using the same or similar queries using flask to that answers could be queried though api routes.  I was able to execute all required queries in python but was unable to make the date/time queries in the final section.  

As a matter of time management, I moved on to the next problems and may come back to complete the final section if I can work it out.
